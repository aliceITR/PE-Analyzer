# PE-Analyzer
Developed in Visual Studio Code, this is a short python script to automate the analysis of PE files for Malware Analysis.
PE Analyzer produces an HTML report detailing information such as a link to the file's VirusTotal page, the compilation date, whether or not it's obfuscated or packaged,
imports, host indicators, and network indicators.
